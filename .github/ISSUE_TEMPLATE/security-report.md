# Reporting Security Issues

Thank you for taking the time to report a security issue. We understand that
this takes time to report and, as such, will be sure to respond quickly and
acknowledge any contributions to the project.

Security reports must include:

- Site version
- Operating system and version (Windows, macOS, Linux+Distribution)
- Node Version (i.e. 12.18.4)
- Dependency and version in question

If possible, include any links to documentation that you have found, as well as
possible fixes.
