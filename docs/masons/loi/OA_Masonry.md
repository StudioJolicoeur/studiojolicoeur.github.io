## Original Connections Between Scouting and Masonry

Freemasonry’s relationship with the Boy Scouts started with a Freemason named Daniel Carter Beard. Bro. Beard was made a Mason in Mariner’s Lodge No. 67, New York City, NY, and later affiliated with Cornucopia Lodge 563, Flushing, NY. In the late 1800’s he founded a male youth program called the “Society of the Sons of Daniel Boone.” By 1905, the program had become “The Boy Pioneers.”

The man who would create the first “Boy Scouts,” and be known as its founder, was Lord Robert Baden-Powell of Great Britain. Lord Baden-Powell, who was not a Mason, read of Beard’s program and, based on his own military experience, developed what is known as the “Boy Scouts.” In 1910, the Boy Scout program came to America when Bro. Beard merged his organization into the “Boy Scouts of America” and became its first National Commissioner.

Bro. Beard, known affectionately as “Uncle Dan” by millions of Boy Scouts, worked tirelessly to create the Scouting Program that we know today. He developed the elements of the Scout badge and the Scout uniform, and wrote and illustrated various early publications of the Boy Scouts of America. Bro. Beard exemplified the Masonic ideals throughout the Scouting program.

Of note, even though Lord Baden-Powell is considered the founder of the Scouting movement in America, he was not a Freemason. The Grand Lodge of England was asked, but no record of his membership could be found.

## The Order of the Arrow
Direct similarities between Scouts and Masonry are thought to reside in the Order of the Arrow, a group that recognizes Scouts and Scouters who best exemplify the Scout Oat and Scout Law in their daily lives. Founded by E. Uner Goodman and Carroll Edison in 1915, it was created as a “camp fraternity” in order to improve the summer camp experience and to keep older boys coming back to camp. According to an interview with Carroll Edison, that task of writing the first rituals and the idea of the society was given to an early member who was also a Mason. This is where the terms of “lodge” and “obligation” used in OA ritual are said to have come from. E. Under Goodman became a Mason  in Lamberton Lodge No. 487 in Philadelphia, PA after the OA was established.

Early national meetings were called a “Grand Lodge” and today the terms “Lodges” and “Chapters” are still in use.

**There are three levels to the OA:**
  - Ordeal
  - Brotherhood
  - Vigil
  _(Each honor has it’s own obligation and ceremony related to it and it’s position.)_

OA Lodges are opened after everyone has proven they are a member through handshakes and/or words. The OA Rituals are similar in that the candidates are conducted via a “friend”, conducted clockwise in a circle and are met with challenges along the way.

Today, The Scouters Lodge blends back together the OA ritual and Masonic rituals when we hold our outdoor degree every summer. It is done via campfire (one at every station and one in the center), in Scout Uniform.

### Interesting quote from Goodman:

    “The Order of the Arrow is a ‘thing of the spirit’ rather than of mechanics. Organization, operational procedure, and paraphernalia are necessary in any large and growing movement, but they are not what count in the end. The things of the spirit count: Brotherhood, in a day when there is too much hatred at home and abroad; Cheerfulness, in a day when the pessimists have the floor; Service, in a day when millions are interested only in getting or grasping rather than giving.”

#### Two points taken from the OA website:

Develop leaders with the willingness, character, spirit and ability to advance the activities of their units, our Brotherhood, Scouting, and ultimately our nation.
Crystallize the Scout habit of helpfulness into a life purpose of leadership in cheerful service to others.

## Masonry and Scouting Today

Today, the connection between Masonry and Scouting exists through shared organizations and Mason either being/becoming leaders in a Scouting group or leaders joining Masonry and forging a connection through similar minded people.

Even though Masonry is not one of the top national supporters of the Boy Scouts (primarily due to it’s perceived encroachment on the DeMolay), there is a growing amount of local support in Massachusetts for Lodges and/or individual Masons supporting the Boy Scouts.

## Masonic and Scouting Organizations

### National Association of Masonic Scouters (NAMS)
  - [nams-bsa.org/](http://www.nams-bsa.org/)
    - The purpose of the National Association of Masonic Scouters is to foster and develop support for the Boy Scouts of America by and among Freemasons while upholding the tenets of Freemasonry.
    - This includes, but is not limited to, encouraging Masonic Lodges and other Masonic organizations to charter and support BSA units. NAMS will seek to provide opportunities for Masonic fellowship at Scouting events and encourage the awarding of the Daniel Carter Beard Award to deserving Masons while supporting the Scouting movement at all levels.
  - At the 2010 National Jamboree, which was the 100th Anniversary of Scouting, NAMS and Fredericksburg Lodge No. 4 opened a Lodge where approximately 500 Masons attended. It was opened on the Entered Apprentice degree with all in attendance wearing Scout uniforms. 3-4 Grand Masters were in attendance, as well as various heads of the York Rite and Scottish Rite bodies.

### The Scouters Lodge A.F. & A.M.
  - [thescouterslodge.org](https://thescouterslodge.org)
    - Formed in 2009 from the beginnings of MMESA under the direction of Most Worshipful Roger W. Pageau. MMESA was formed for the purpose of providing a Masonic presence at Boy Scouts of America Eagle Scout Courts of Honor, as well as to establish a network of Masonic Eagle Scout in the Grand Jurisdiction of Massachusetts.
    - Today, The Scouters Lodge travels across the jurisdiction (and sometimes out of state, with permission) presenting Eagle Scouts with certificates from the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts, as well as any other awards that the Lodge may wish to present. This has opened up many doors for the Lodge, as well as gained interest in Masonry from Scout Leaders that did not know there was a connection, or were unsure of the connection.
    - Requirements for membership are either having attained the rank of Eagle Scout as a youth, or been honored with the Daniel Carter Beard Masonic Scouter Award.
